## Overview
SALSA-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that non-invasively analyzes local stability in the latent action space. By modeling actions as time-varying linear dynamics, it applies control-theoretic tools, such as spectral radius, transient growth, and Floquet analysis, for stability analysis. SALSA-RL enables interpretation of pretrained agents, early warning of control failures, and insight into policy behavior without modifying the policy or training process, and with no loss in performance.
