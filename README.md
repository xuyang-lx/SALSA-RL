## Overview
SALSA-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that non-invasively analyzes local stability in the latent action space. By modeling actions as time-varying linear dynamics, it applies control-theoretic tools—such as spectral radius, transient growth, and Floquet analysis—for fine-grained stability diagnostics. SALSA-RL enables interpretation of pretrained agents, early detection of control failures, and improved safety—all without modifying the policy or training process, and with no loss in performance.
